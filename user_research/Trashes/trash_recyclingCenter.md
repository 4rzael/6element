# General information about trashes

The main trashes which are collected in RC are [D's I]:
1) green trashes
2) bulkies (chair, toys, ...)
3) wood

![Trashes in RC](../Pictures/RCTrashes.png)

We can talk about trashes in three different ways:
* Collect  (CUB)
* Treatment (CUB)
* Planning (Department) :  They carry on **reducing and promote remaining trashes**. To do that, they elaborate a 12 years action plan, which has a prospective aim and consistent with the European project. L Vitry works on that, for instance by organizing workshops, making indicator, ... 

There are **83 recycling centers** in Gironde
There are **2 storage center** , where they bury trashes, in Gironde.

**Machines which are not broken** are not re-used and are thrown out (in Gironde). Only Ustom keep them (they sort them by themselves) and store them in a **"recyclerie" ( != recycling center)** (same concept as Emmaüs). It is located in Pessac sur Dordogne. [LV's I]

![Trashes in Gironde](../Pictures/trashes_Gironde.jpg)

There are **3 different ways to throw out trashes** [LV's I]:
* Door to door/"Porte à porte" (**PAP**) : waste trucks
* "Point d'apport volontaire" (**PAV**): sorting point (*=borne de tri*). There are also cities which don't pick unrecycling trashes but place some public recycling bins (*in order to have less unrecycling trashes?*)
* Recycling centers

**Bulky systems** (*=encombrants*) are not included in this organization because it doesn't always depend on cities. Trashes from bulky system have the same destiny if they are collected by the collectivity. Otherwise, they are usually not recycled but directly burned or burried. [LV's I]

**Compost** is currently not collected separately from the others trashes.  [LV's I]
* *Personal consideration : That's too bad,  Idea of a new project about compost collection?*

(It is not the same organization/distribution in the entire country [LV's I])

Ustom carries on **recycling centers and trashes' collection** [Delphine's Interview]: 
* In order to sort their trashes, it has been 2 years that Ustom makes **people pay for household waste** depending on their weight. People have thrown out less recycling trashes inside non-recycling bins since that decision. 
* There are **12,000 tones of household** trashes in 2014 against **14,000 tones of recycling** trashes whearas household used to be superior before the motivational tax
    
The **rush hour** of Ustom's RC are at 10 am and 3 pm [D's I]

**Time spent in RC** [D's I]:
 * Users spend around **5-6 min inside** the RC
 * During rush hours, people are **waiting aroud 15 minutes** at the entry 
  * *Personal consideration : Perfect to place an ad about 6element*
  
In summer, bin are usually full and **people must come back at home with trashes** : *"It would be great to have the information in live"* [d's I]

Bins are undersized [USTOM]

Summer increases the number of each trashes, **not only green ones**

When a **bin is almost full after compacting**, RC's agent must call SMICVAL to empty it. They never change a bin which is not full [SMICVAL agent]

A **trash compactor visit** the RC several times a day for **cardboard, green trashes, wood and bulky** (dechets enfouis/tout-venant/encombrant): at St Mariens and St Denis de Pile, the compactor comes **3 times a day**. Agents don't have to call it, it uses to regularly aroud 9 ,11:30am and 3:30pm [St Mariens]

The **bin truck** arrives usually betwen 2 and 4 hours [St Mariens]

**Bin truck** needs around 20 minutes to change a bin. During that space of time, users cannot throw out garbages.

**Queuing** would be belittled if people were **sorting their trashes before coming in RC**.

St Mariens and St Denis de Pile are equiped with card detector but not Libourne's RCs and Verac, which are smaller [SMICVAL obs]

The crowd is discontinuous, **prime time** are Satudray, Monday morning and Friday afternoon [St Denis, Libourne (both) and Verac]

It doesn't often append that people have to come back at home with trashes because bins are full.

At St Denis de Pile, on Saturday, people sometimes **wait** untill one hour to throw out trashes.

There are around **2 parking places per bin** [SMICVAL  obs]

Bins' categories are not always well-indicated and people are lost, they need the agent to find where they have to throw out their trashes [SMICVAL obs ]

In places where there are a not a lot of Emmaüs, people must throw a lot of things that could have a **second life** [SMICVAL and specifically Libourne B]


# Users
**Students** usually don't use recycling center [doc LV]

Example for a given recycling center: 
* 40,000 people live in the area. 5,000 users. 96,000 visits a year [doc LV]
  * a user comes **19 times a year** in the recycling center
 * *Personal consideration* : It would be more relevant to talk about home instead of people

People leaving in detached house with garden are the **main users** of recycling center [Vitry's interview]

Ustom's RC are base in country area so there mainly country persons[D's I]

There are a lot of **retired person** coming and almost **every day** to have **social interaction**: they usually throw out some bottles. These persons represent a little percentage but they come around **200 times a year** [D's I]
**Retired person** represent more than **50%** of RC's users [D's I]

Users come between **1 and 5 times a year** in RC [D's T]

The user which is the most representative is **family's father coming after spring-clean** [D's I]

There are a lot of **farmers**, wine-makers, ... in Aquitaine so they represent a big part of users [Delphine's interview]

**Urbans** don't come in recycling center, they throw out their trashes on the street. [V's I]

St Denis de Pile and St Mariens receive a LOT of retired persone, who come several times a week to throw out a little but around Libourne and Verac, users are more varied. 

Young people around 30 come mostly because of move or house work, 40's because of spring cleaning and gardening and old person because of gardening [SMICVAL]

Gardners come several times a week in summer period [SMICVAL]

A lot of persons don't know where can they leave their clothes (Relais, etc. )

People are embarassed to throw out things that could be reused.

There are also a lot of persons asking for recovering stuff.

*Can we reach camera recording?*

Recycling centers mastered by Ustom guest particular and professional users [D's I]

* *Users* : RC count **22,000 particulars for 1,000 professionals**


**Professionals** :
* come to the RC at the end of the day : around **5 and 6 pm**

* can be farmers (green trashes), workmen (plaster, ...) , entrepreneurs (cardboard, paper, polyester ...) [D's I]
* A lot of public recycling centers are not made for professionals who are supposed to use **private professional recycling centers**. There are **5-6** in this kind in Gironde. Some local authority accept them in recycling centers but *try* to make them pay. [LV's I]


Only St Denis de Pile is authorized to receive professionals : these one must paye and are limited [SMICVAL]

The **town concils** are also users. 

![Professional](../Pictures/professional.png)

Punctual users: punctual events such as a move or spring clean. [doc LV]
 
Bigger the place we live in is, more trashes we can accumulate before throwing out everything at the same time. People living in tiny places can't keep any trash and have to throw them out immediately. [doc LV]
 * *How do they solve this problem?* 
 
Gardening period is from March to November [internet]

People (specifically women and old persons) needing help to discharge their trashes should not come during rush hours [USTOM]

Agents are not allowed to help users [SMICVAL]



# Problems

Some users don't trust the informations given by recycling centers  [doc LV]: 
« Dans la maison, on entasse pas mal… » « On a fait le grand rangement il n’y a pas longtemps. » « On est allé à la déchèterie la plus proche… ». « Le camion était blindé, ils étaient en grève ! ». « Du coup il y avait un tas énorme devant l’entrée de la déchèterie, mon camion était plein de merdes pendant deux semaines. Ça c’est un truc pénible, quand toi tu fais l’effort de charger ta bagnole et que c’est plein ou que c’est fermé. »

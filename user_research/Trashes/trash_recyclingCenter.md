# General information about trashes

The main trashes which are collected in RC are [D's I]:
1. green trashes
2. bulkies (chair, toys, ...)
3. wood

![Trashes in RC](RCTrashes.png)

We can talk about trashes in three different ways:
* Collect  (CUB)
* Treatment (CUB)
* Planning (Department) :  They carry on **reducing and promote remaining trashes**. To do that, they elaborate a 12 years action plan, which has a prospective aim and consistent with the European project. L Vitry works on that, for instance by organizing workshops, making indicator, ... 

There are **83 recycling centers** in Gironde
There are **2 storage center** , where they bury trashes, in Gironde.

**Machines which are not broken** are not re-used and are thrown out (in Gironde). Only Ustom keep them (they sort them by themselves) and store them in a **"recyclerie" ( != recycling center)** (same concept as Emmaüs). It is located in Pessac sur Dordogne. [LV's I]

There are **3 different ways to throw out trashes** [LV's I]:
* Door to door/"Porte à porte" (**PAP**) : wast trucks
* "Point d'apport volontaire" (**PAV**): sorting point (*=borne de tri*). There are also cities which don't pick unrecycling trashes but place some public recycling bins (*in order to have less unrecycling trashes?*)
* Recycling centers

**Bulky systems** (*=encombrants*) are not included in this organization because it doesn't always depend on cities. Trashes from bulky system have the same destiny if they are collected by the collectivity. Otherwise, they are usually not recycled but directly burned or burried. [LV's I]

**Compost** is currently not collected separately from the others trashes.  [LV's I]
* *Personal consideration : That's too bad,  Idea of a new project about compost collection?*

(It is not the same organization/distribution in the entire country [LV's I])

Ustom carries on **recycling centers and trashes' collection** [Delphine's Interview]: 
* In order to sort their trashes, it has been 2 years that Ustom make **people pay for household waste** depending on their weight. People have thrown out less recycling trashes inside non-recycling bins since that decision. 
* There are **12,000 tones of household** trashes in 2014 against **14,000 tones of recycling** trashes whearas household used to be superior before the motivational taxe
    
The **rush hour** of Ustom's RC are at 10 am and 3 pm [D's I]

**Time spend in RC** [D's I]:
 * Users spend around **5-6 min inside** the RC
 * During rush hours, people are **waiting aroud 15 minutes** at the entry 
  * *Personal consideration : Perfect to place an ad about 6element* :+1: 
  
In summer, bin are usually full and **people must come back at home with trashes** : *"It would be great to have the information in live"* [d's I]

Bins are under-sized (*sous-dimensionnées?*)

Summer increases the number of each trashes, not only green ones

![Professional](professional.png)

unctual users: punctual events such as a move or spring clean. [doc LV]
 
Bigger the place we live in is, more trashes we can accumulate before throwing out everything at the same time. People living in tiny places can't keep any trash and have to throw them out immediately. [doc LV]
 * *How do they solve this problem?* 
 
Gardening period is from March to November [internet]

People (specifically women and old persons) needing help to discharge their trashes should not come during rush hours

# Problems

Some users don't trust the informations given by recycling centers  [doc LV]: 
« Dans la maison, on entasse pas mal… » « On a fait le grand rangement il n’y a pas longtemps. » « On est allé à la déchèterie la plus proche… ». « Le camion était blindé, ils étaient en grève ! ». « Du coup il y avait un tas énorme devant l’entrée de la déchèterie, mon camion était plein de merdes pendant deux semaines. Ça c’est un truc pénible, quand toi tu fais l’effort de charger ta bagnole et que c’est plein ou que c’est fermé. »

# General information about trashes

The main trashes collected in RC are [D's I]:

1) green trashes

2) bulkies (chair, toys, ...)

3) wood

![Trashes in RC](../Pictures/RCTrashes.png)

We can talk about trashes in three different ways:
* Collect  (CUB)
* Treatment (CUB)
* Planning (Department) :  *They work on **reducing and promoting remaining trashes**. In order to do that, they elaborate a 12-years action plan, which has a prospective aim and which is consistent with the European project. L Vitry works on that, for instance by organizing workshops, making indicators, ... *

Gironde:
* **83 recycling centers** 
* **2 storage centers**  *(where they bury trashes)*

**Machines which are not broken** are not re-used and are thrown out (in Gironde). Only Ustom keep them (they sort them by themselves) and store them in a **"recyclerie" ( != recycling center)** (same concept as Emmaüs). It is located in Pessac sur Dordogne. [LV's I]
Smicval's agents are not allowed to keep/give anything.

There are **3 different ways to throw out trashes** [LV's I]:
* Door to door/"Porte à porte" (**PAP**) : waste trucks
* "Point d'apport volontaire" (**PAV**): sorting point (*=borne de tri*). There are also cities which don't pick unrecycling trashes but place some public recycling bins (*in order to have less unrecycling trashes?*)
* Recycling centers

**"Encombrants" pick up** is not included in this organization because it doesn't always depend on cities. Trashes from "encombrants" have the same ending if they are collected by the collectivity. Otherwise, they are usually not recycled but directly burned or burried. [LV's I]

This schema is about trashes collected in **bulky bins in RC**:
![Bulky](../Pictures/bulky.png)

**Compost** is currently not collected appart from the others trashes.  [LV's I]
* *Personal consideration : That's too bad,  Idea of a new project about compost collection?*

Ustom deals with **recycling centers and trashes' collection** [Delphine's Interview]: 
* In order to sort their trashes, it has been 2 years that Ustom makes **people pay for household waste** depending on their weight. People have thrown out less recycling trashes inside non-recycling bins since that decision. 
* There are **12,000 tones of household trashes** in 2014 against **14,000 tones of recyclable trashes** *(whearas household used to be superior before the motivational tax)*
    
The **rush hour** of Ustom's RC are at 10 am and 3 pm [D's I]

**Time spent in RC** [D's I]:
 * Users spend around **5-6 min inside** the RC
 * During rush hours, people are **waiting aroud 15 minutes** at the entry 
  * *Personal consideration : Perfect to place an ad about 6element*
  
In summer, bins are usually full and **people must go back home with their trashes** : *"It would be great to have live updates"* [d's I]

Bins are undersized [USTOM]

Summer increases the number of each trashes, **not only green ones**

When a **bin is almost full after compacting**, RC's agent must call SMICVAL to empty it. They are not allowed to change a bin which is not full and compacted [SMICVAL agent]

A **trash compactor** visits the RC several times a day for **cardboard, green trashes, wood and bulky** (dechets enfouis/tout-venant/encombrant): at St Mariens and St Denis de Pile, the compactor comes **3 times a day**. It uses to come regularly aroud 9 ,11:30am and 3:30pm [St Mariens]

**Bin truck** :
* arrives usually after 2/4 hours [St Mariens]
* needs around 20 minutes to change a bin. During that space of time, users cannot throw out garbages.

**Queuing** would be belittled if people were **sorting their trashes before coming to RC**.

St Mariens and St Denis de Pile are equiped with card detector but neither Libourne's RCs nor Verac, which are smaller, have one [SMICVAL obs]

The crowd is discontinuous, **rush hours** are Saturdays, Monday mornings and Friday afternoons [St Denis, Libourne (both) and Verac]

People don't often have to come back at home with their trashes because bins are full.

At St Denis de Pile, on Saturdays, people sometimes **wait** untill one hour to throw out their trashes.

There are around **2 parking lots per bin** [SMICVAL  obs]

Bins' categories are not always well-indicated and people are lost, they need the agent to find where they have to throw out their trashes [SMICVAL obs ]

In places where there are not a lot of Emmaüs, people must throw a lot of things that could have got a **second life** [SMICVAL and specifically Libourne B]


# Users
**Students** don't usually use recycling centers [doc LV]

Example of a given recycling center: 
* 40,000 people live in the area. 5,000 users. 96,000 visits a year [doc LV]
  * a user comes **19 times a year** in the recycling center
 * *Personal consideration* : It would be more relevant to talk about household instead of people

People leaving in suburban houses with garden are the **main users** of recycling centers [Vitry's interview]

Ustom's RC are based in country area so there are mainly countryside people[D's I]

There are a lot of **retired people** coming in and almost **every day** to get **social interactions**: they usually throw out a few bottles. These people represent a little percentage but they come around **200 times a year** [D's I]
**Retired people** represent more than **50%** of RC's users [D's I]

Users come between **1 and 5 times a year** in RC [D's T]

The user which is the most representative is **the family's father coming after spring-cleaning** [D's I]

There are a lot of **farmers** and  wine-makers in Aquitaine and they represent a big part of RCs'users [Delphine's interview]

**Urbans** don't come in recycling center, they throw out their trashes on the street. [V's I]

St Denis de Pile and St Mariens receive a LOT of retired people, who come several times a week to throw out only a few things but around Libourne and Verac, users are more diversified. 

Young people around 30 years old come mostly because of moves or house works, 40 years old users because of spring cleaning or gardening and eldery people because of gardening [SMICVAL]

Gardners come several times a week in summer period [SMICVAL]

A lot of persons don't know where can they leave their clothes (Relais, etc. )

People are not comfortable with the idea of throwing things out that could be reused.

There are also a lot of persons asking to recover stuffs.

*Can we reach camera recording?*

Recycling centers mastered by Ustom guest particular and professional users [D's I]
* *Visit* :For 100 visitors, there are around **70 particulars for 30 professionals**
* *Users* : RC count **22,000 particulars for 1,000 professionals**


**Professionals** :
* come to the RC at the end of the day : around **5 and 6 pm**
* pay 120€ per year** in Ustom's RC: they can come as often as they wish but are limited to 3m³ per week [D's I]
* can be farmers (green trashes), workmen (plaster, ...) , entrepreneurs (cardboard, paper, polyester ...) [D's I]
* A lot of public recycling centers are not made for professionals who are supposed to use **private professional recycling centers**. There are **5-6** in this kind in Gironde. Some local authority accept them in recycling centers but *try* to make them pay. [LV's I]


Only St Denis de Pile is authorized to receive professionals : these ones must pay and are limited [SMICVAL]

The **city halls** are also users [St Denis de Pile]. 

![Professional](../Pictures/professional.png)

Punctual users: punctual events such as a move or a spring clean. [doc LV]
 
The bigger the place we live in is, the bigger the amount of trashes is *(before throwing everything out at the same time)*. People living in tiny places can't keep any trash and have to throw them out immediately. [doc LV + Libourne's agent]
 * *How do they solve this problem?* 
 
Gardening period is from March to November [internet]

People (specifically women and eldery people) needing help to discharge their trashes should not come during rush hours [USTOM]

Agents are not allowed to help users [SMICVAL]

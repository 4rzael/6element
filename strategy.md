# Strategy

Plenty of things to do. Limited resources.

## Purpose

Reduce waste arriving in recycling centers

## Technical outcomes

* make a sensor collecting affluence information
* make a sensor collecting bin levels information
* make a back-end collecting these data
* make a prediction model both for affluence and bin levels
* make an app exposing these info to citizens
* make a database of alternatives to recylcing centers
* make the part of the app that matches people throwing something and alternatives
* make a dashboard to follow all that

## Timing constraints

Sensors need to be done before the database, but will take time. Create the database and prepare backend before sensors send real data.
